I think what I appreciated most about this assignment was being able to get more familiar with QT and being able to see
just how easy the functionality is. I love the fact that it's as easy as having a push button named something like "submit"
and then simply using self.submit.clicked.connect(self.pressed()) and then defining pressed() to be whatever you want and further more
if you want to call other methods or method fucntions with pressed() all you have to do is something like self.plot(x,y) from within pressed
and you'll get a graph!
Sometimes programming can be a little intimidating so it can be cool to see just how straight forward somethings are and having this experience
with QT definitely makes me appreciate the applications I use more. I also want to explore PYQT and python in general for 3d graphing.
